Yet another Static Site Generator.

**0.0.3 starting to work**

First goals: 

- Simple site generators from a `content/` to "output" directory ready to be sync for static serving
- Supports `.html` and `.md`
- Transcode to extension less html files (no more `my-page/` for all html files)
- Supports custom `runners`
- Great to publish to S3 or other serverless site structure.
